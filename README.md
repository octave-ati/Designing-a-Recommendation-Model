# Creating a Recommendation application

In this project, I design the backend of a mobile application used to recommend
articles to users of a website.

The application is created with the Expo XDE and designed with React.js.

It is connected to a prediction API that I created and deployed with
Azure Functions.

I present 3 types of recommendation models :
- A collaborative filtering model
- A content-based model
- A hybrid model that takes input from both methods

At the end of the project (cf. Notebook), I tried to implement a deep learning model but
failed because of a lack of computing power.
